# Sleep Diary Formats

The project has now moved to [Sleep Diary Library](https://github.com/sleepdiary/library).  This repository is no longer being updated.

The new repository contains some minor breaking changes, including:

* references to `sleep-diary` are now `sleepdiary`
* references to `format` are now `engine`

This repository will remain online for the foreseaable future, so you can keep using it if you don't want to change your code.
